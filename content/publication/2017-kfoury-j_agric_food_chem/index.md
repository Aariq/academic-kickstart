  Plants produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with diverse structures and
  functions, which change in response to environmental stimuli and have
  important consequences for interactions with other organisms. To understand
  these changes, *in situ* sampling is necessary. In contrast to dynamic
  headspace (DHS), which is the most often employed method, direct contact
  sampling employing a magnetic stir bar held in place by a magnet eliminates
  artifacts produced by enclosing plant materials in glass or plastic chambers.
  Direct-contact sorptive extraction (DCSE) using polydimethylsiloxane coated
  stir bars (Twisters) coated stir bars is more sensitive than DHS, captures a
  wider range of compounds, minimizes VOC collection from neighboring plants,
  and distinguishes the effects of herbivory in controlled and field conditions.
  Because DCSE is relatively inexpensive and simple to employ, scalability of
  field trials can be expanded concomitant with increased sample replication.
  The sensitivity of DCSE combined with the spectral deconvolution data analysis
  software makes the two ideal for comprehensive, *in situ* profiling of plant
  volatiles.

  To understand plant volatile production in response to environmental stimuli,
  *in situ* sampling is necessary.  Direct contact sorptive extraction (DCSE)
  involves placing a PDMS-coated magnetic stir bar (Twisters) in direct contact
  with a leaf using a magnet.  In contrast to dynamic headspace sampling (DHS),
  this eliminates artifacts produced by enclosing plants in a chamber. We
  demonstrate that DCSE is more sensitive than DHS, captures a wider range of
  compounds, and is relatively inexpensive and simple to deploy making it ideal
  for *in situ* sampling of plant volatiles.
