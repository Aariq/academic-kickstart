  The four species of *Dasineura Rondani* previously reported from goldenrods in
  North America were revisited, resulting in the synonymy of two species and the
  redescription of diagnostic characters of adults and galls. *Dasineura
  folliculi* Felt is reported from *Solidago rugosa* Miller and *S. gigantea*
  Aiton, and *D. carbonaria* Felt is reported from *Euthamia graminifolia* (L.)
  Nuttall. Both species induce simple leaf-cluster galls on shoot tips of their
  relative hosts. *Dasineura folliculi* completes for to five generations, and
  *D. carbonaria* completes at least two generations between May and October.
  Emergence rates were relatively low; they ranged from 36 to 51%, suggesting a
  large proportion of the larval population does not pupate and instead enters
  diapause in the ground. *D. folliculi* galls were attacked by five species of
  parasitic wasps and by inquilinous and predatory gall midges and caterpillars.
  Levels of attack by parasitoids increased, whereas levels of attack by
  inquilines decreased, as the season progressed. Field data and greenhouse
  experiments indicated that both Dasineura species exhibit monogeny, whereby
  females produce unisexual broods. Galls resulting from a single oviposition
  event exclusively yielded single-sex adults, whereas 7â€“33% of field-collected
  galls yielded adults of both sexes, suggesting they contained the progeny of
  more than one female. Gall sex ratios differed between generations of *D.
  folliculi* on *S. rugosa* but not on *S. gigantea*.
