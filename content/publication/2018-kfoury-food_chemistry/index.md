  Climate effects on crop quality at the molecular level are not
  well-understood. Gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to
  measure changes of hundreds of compounds in tea at different elevations in
  Yunnan Province, China. Some increased in concentration while others decreased
  by 100’s of percent. Orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant
  analysis revealed compounds exhibiting analgesic, antianxiety, antibacterial,
  anticancer, antidepressant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
  anti-stress, and cardioprotective properties statistically (p=0.003)
  differentiated high from low elevation tea. Also, sweet, floral, honey-like
  notes were higher in concentration in the former while the latter displayed
  grassy, hay-like aroma. In addition, multivariate analysis of variance showed
  low elevation tea had statistically (p=0.0062) higher concentrations of
  caffeine, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and catechin; all bitter
  compounds. Although volatiles represent a small fraction of the total mass,
  this is the first comprehensive report illustrating how normal variations in
  temperature, 5 °C, due to elevational effects impact tea quality.
