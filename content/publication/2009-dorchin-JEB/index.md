  Host-associated differentiation (HAD) is considered a step towards ecological
  speciation and an important mechanism promoting diversification in
  phytophagous insects. Although the number of documented cases of HAD is
  increasing, these still represent only a small fraction of species and feeding
  guilds among phytophagous insects, and most reports are based on a single type
  of evidence. Here we employ a comprehensive approach to present behavioural,
  morphological, ecological and genetic evidence for the occurrence of HAD in
  the gall midge *Dasineura folliculi* (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on two sympatric
  species of goldenrods (*Solidago rugosa* and *S. gigantea*). Controlled
  experiments revealed assortative mating and strong oviposition fidelity for
  the natal-host species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed an amount of
  genetic divergence between the two host-associated populations compatible with
  cryptic species rather than host races. Lower levels of within-host genetic
  divergence, gall development and natural-enemy attack in the *S. gigantea*
  population suggest this is the derived host.
