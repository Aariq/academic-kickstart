I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Emilio Bruna's lab](http://brunalab.org/) at University of Florida working on the effects of drought and habitat fragmentation on a tropical plant.  I'm interested in the mechanisms of plant responses to stress and their consequences for natural and agricultural ecosystems.  [My Ph.D. focus](http://teaclimate.org) was on the effects of climate change and insect herbivory on the quality (flavor and health benefits) of tea (*Camellia sinensis*).
