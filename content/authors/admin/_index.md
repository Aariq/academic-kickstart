bio: I recently recieved my PhD in Biology from Tufts University with an emphasis on chemical ecology.  I'm interested in the mechanisms of plant defense and their consequences for natural and agricultural ecosystems.  My Ph.D. focus was on the effects of climate change and insect herbivory on the quality (flavor and health benefits) of tea (*Camellia sinensis*)

I recently recieved my PhD in Biology from Tufts University with an emphasis on chemical ecology. I'm currently looking for a postdoc position. I'm interested in the mechanisms of plant defense and their consequences for natural and agricultural ecosystems.  My dissertation focus was on the effects of climate change and insect herbivory on the quality (flavor and health benefits) of tea (*Camellia sinensis*).
