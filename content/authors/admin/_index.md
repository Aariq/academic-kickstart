I'm a research software engineer and data science educator at the University of Arizona with a background in chemical ecology, plant-insect interactions, and plant population ecology. [My Ph.D. focus](http://teaclimate.org) was on the effects of climate change and insect herbivory on the quality (flavor and health benefits) of tea (*Camellia sinensis*).
