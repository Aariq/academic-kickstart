I've been teaching biology ever since I was 12 when I became an interpretive guide at the [Lindsay Wildlife Experience](https://lindsaywildlife.org/) in my home town of Walnut Creek, CA.  Since then I've taught science of all sorts to all ages in a variety of formats.

## Selected Teaching Experience:
 - **Ecological Statistics and Data**. *Spring 2020*. I took over this course during my last semester as a PhD student as the instructor of record. I reorganized the syllabus and created new content to teach genearlized linear models and mixed effects models with ecological applications using R.
 - **Biostatstics in R**. *Fall 2016--2018*. Recitation section for BIO132 at Tufts University. In collaboration with Natalie Kerr in 2016 and Avalon Owens in 2018, we designed and taught this new course.  Previously, BIO132 used SPSS rather than R and did not have a required recitation. Course materials available [here](https://github.com/Aariq/biotstatistics-recitation-2018).
 - **Organisms and Populations**. *Spring 2015*. Lab section for BIO0014 at Tufts University.  I served as a graduate TA for a lab section of this course in a year when the course was being entirely redesigned.  I actively participated in designing course materials and lab activities in addition to teaching my own lab section.
 - **Introductory Biology**.  *2011 -- 2014*. I taught a guaranteed transfer credit lecture and lab course at Front Range Community College in Fort Collins, CO where I was an instructor.  My students came from diverse age, socioeconomic, and learning backgrounds.  I designed lectures and assessment materials and engaged in revising lab exercises and course materials. I attended professional development workshops including an especially helpful one on teaching veterans.
